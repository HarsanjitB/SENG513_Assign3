## Snakes - Multiplayer
***Title:*** Snakes - Multiplayer \
***Target Platform:*** The following game is developed for desktop only. \
***Game Genre:*** Snakes Multiplayer is considered a strategy game. \
***Games Objective:*** The objective in Snakes - Multiplayer is to outlive your opponent. This game is designed to be played by two players using the same keyboard. Player One uses keys WASD and Player Two uses the arrow keys to navigate the grid. 

****Rules of the Game:**** Once the game begins, each player will navigate the game board. The objective of the game is to survive on the game board longer than your opponent. 

Green Blocks - Food for your snake. Eating a green block will increase your score by 1. Your snake will also get longer. 
Black Blocks - Do not run into these blocks. If you hit a black block, you will minus 1 point from your score and the black block will disappear (treat your score as lives against black blocks).
Purple Block - A single rare block that will clear all black blocks on your grid. 

If you have a score of zero and hit a black block, the game is over and your opponent wins! If you hit your opponent's snake or the grid walls, you automatically lose (regardless of your score).

***Game Mechanics:*** Player One would use the WASD keys to navigate and move the board. Player Two would use the arrow keys.
